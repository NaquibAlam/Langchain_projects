Oh, give us the one about the Dirty Rascal, why don't ya?. Isn't that one a bit long?. Well, the quicker you're into it, the quicker you're out of it.. . Once upon a time, in a nursery rhyme. There was a castle with a king hiding in a wing. 'Cause he never went to school to learn a single thing. He had sceptres and swords and a parliament of lords. But on the inside he was sad, egad!. Because he never had a wisdom for numbers, a wisdom for words. Though his crown was quite immense, his brain was smaller than a bird's. . So the queen of the nation made a royal proclamation. To the Misses and the Messrs, the More-or-Lessers, bring me all the land's professors. Then she went to the hairdresser's. And they came from the east and they came from the south. From each college they poured knowledge from their brains into his mouth. But the king couldn't learn, so each professor met their fate. For the queen had their heads removed and placed upon the gate. And on that date, I state their wives all got a note their mate was now the late great. . But then suddenly one day a stranger started in to sing. He said I'm the Dirty Rascal, and I'm here to teach the king. And the queen clutched her jewels, for she hated royal fools. But this fool had some rules they really ought to teach in schools. Like you'll be a happy king if you enjoy the things you've got. You should never try to be the kind of person that you're not. . So they sang and they laughed, for the king had found a friend. And they ran on to a rainbow for the story's perfect end. So the moral is you musn't let the outside be the guide. For it's not so cut and dried. Well, unless it's Dr. Jekyll, then you'd better hide, petrified. Now the truth can't be denied. As I know I've testified. All that really counts and matters is the special stuff inside. (He did it!). . Oh, a cover is not the book. So open it up and take a look. 'Cause under the covers one discovers. That the king may be a crook. So please listen to what we've said. And open a book tonight in bed. So one more time before we get the hook (sing it out strong!). A cover is nice. Please take our advice. A cover is nice. Or you'll pay the price. A cover is nice. But a cover is not the book!. Taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, taroo-ra-li taroo-ra-la, la, la!. .
