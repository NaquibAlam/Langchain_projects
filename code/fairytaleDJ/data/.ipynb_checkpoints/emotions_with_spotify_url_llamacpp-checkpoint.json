To see her is to take a sudden chill. Cruella, Cruella. She's like a spider waiting for the kill. Look out for Cruella De Vil. . At first you think Cruella is a devil. But after time has worn away the shock. You come to realize. You've seen her kind of eyes. Watching you from underneath a rock. . This vampire bat, this inhuman beast. She ought to be locked up and never released. The world was such a wholesome place until. Cruella, Cruella De Vil. . "}]}
